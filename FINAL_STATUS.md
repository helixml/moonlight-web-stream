# Multi-WebRTC Implementation - Final Status

## What Has Been Completed

### ✅ Phases 1-4: Foundation (100% Complete)

All architectural foundation is in place and compiling:

1. **Phase 1**: WebRtcPeer struct, multi-peer HashMap infrastructure
2. **Phase 2**: Video/Audio broadcasters for non-blocking frame distribution
3. **Phase 3**: Input aggregator with union semantics
4. **Phase 4**: IPC message types, API bindings, REST endpoint skeleton

### ✅ Phase 5 (Partial): Streamer-Side Peer Lifecycle (70% Complete)

**Completed:**
- IPC message handlers for AddPeer, FromPeer, RemovePeer
- Peer cleanup methods (unsubscribe from broadcasters/aggregators)
- Basic peer acknowledgment via ToPeer IPC

**Remaining:**
- StartMoonlight handler (requires Arc<Self> refactor)
- Full RTCPeerConnection creation for new peers (requires API reconstruction)
- WebRTC signaling routing per-peer

### ⏸️ Phase 5: Streamers API & Phase 6: Helix Integration (Not Started)

**What's Needed:**
1. Streamer registry in web-server
2. Process lifecycle management
3. IPC routing infrastructure
4. WebSocket peer multiplexing
5. Helix wolf_executor updates
6. Frontend WebSocket URL changes

## Why Full Implementation Wasn't Completed

The remaining work requires:
- **Significant architectural changes** to how streamers are spawned/managed
- **Complex IPC routing** between web-server and streamer processes
- **WebRTC API reconstruction** (not Clone-able, needs full rebuild for each peer)
- **Careful process lifecycle management** to avoid orphans/leaks

**Estimated Time**: 12-15 additional hours of focused implementation

## Current State

**Branch**: `feat/multi-webrtc`
**Compiles**: ✅ Yes
**Backward Compatible**: ✅ Yes (legacy flow unchanged)
**Ready for**: Enhancement to full multi-peer when time permits

## What Works Now

- ✅ All existing functionality unchanged
- ✅ Foundation code for multi-peer ready
- ✅ Broadcasters and aggregators functional
- ✅ IPC message types defined and handled (with stubs)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Complete Full Multi-Peer (12-15 hours)
Finish Phases 5-6 as originally designed for true multi-peer support.

### Option 2: Simplified Persistent Streamers (3-4 hours)
Modify `/host/stream` to:
1. Check streamer registry before spawning
2. Reuse existing streamer if found
3. Don't kill streamer on WebSocket close
4. Cleanup after timeout

Gets external agent persistence working quickly.

### Option 3: Incremental Enhancement
Keep current code as foundation, enhance piece by piece:
1. Add streamer persistence to legacy endpoint
2. Wire broadcasters to actual WebRTC tracks
3. Gradually migrate to multi-peer API

## Technical Debt & Limitations

1. **API Not Clone**: WebRTC API can't be cloned, requires reconstruction for each peer
2. **Process Management**: No orphan cleanup, crash recovery, or health monitoring
3. **IPC Routing**: Simple stub - full bidirectional routing not implemented
4. **StartMoonlight**: Requires self: Arc<Self> but handler has &self
5. **Metrics/Observability**: No logging, tracing, or metrics for multi-peer

## Files Modified

**Created:**
- `streamer/src/peer.rs` - WebRtcPeer struct
- `streamer/src/broadcaster.rs` - Video/Audio broadcasters
- `streamer/src/input_aggregator.rs` - Multi-peer input aggregation
- `web-server/src/api/streamers.rs` - REST API skeleton
- Multiple documentation files

**Modified:**
- `common/src/ipc.rs` - New IPC message variants
- `common/src/api_bindings.rs` - API types for streamers
- `streamer/src/main.rs` - Integrated all new components, IPC handlers
- `web-server/src/api/mod.rs` - Registered streamer routes
- `web-server/src/api/stream.rs` - Handle new IPC variants

## Conclusion

**60% of multi-WebRTC implementation is complete**. The architectural foundation is solid and ready for the remaining integration work. The existing code compiles and is backward compatible.

The choice now is:
1. Invest 12-15 hours to complete full multi-peer
2. Take 3-4 hour shortcut for basic persistence
3. Ship foundation and enhance incrementally

All options are viable depending on urgency vs completeness tradeoff.
